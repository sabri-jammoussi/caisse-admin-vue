## Introduction
Vue.js is a progressive framework for building web applications. It's engineered to be incrementally adoptable, allowing for seamless transitions between a lightweight library and a powerful framework, depending on the requirements of your project. Vue.js centers around a flexible core library that prioritizes the view layer, supplemented by a vibrant ecosystem of complementary libraries. This setup equips you to effectively handle complexities within extensive Single-Page Applications.
